# File Upload Fixes - PDF Corruption Prevention

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Filename Sanitization Corruption**
**Problem**: The original code was converting filenames to lowercase and aggressively replacing characters, which could corrupt file extensions.

**Fix**: 
- Preserve original file extension exactly as uploaded
- Only sanitize the base filename, not the extension
- Use minimal character replacement to avoid corruption

### 2. **Express Middleware Interference**
**Problem**: `express.json()` middleware was potentially interfering with binary file uploads.

**Fix**:
- Reordered middleware to serve static files before API routes
- Added proper size limits and configuration
- Added specific headers for PDF files

### 3. **Missing File Validation**
**Problem**: No verification that uploaded files are actually valid PDFs.

**Fix**:
- Added PDF magic number verification (%PDF header)
- Added PDF trailer verification (%%EOF)
- Added file integrity checks

### 4. **Inconsistent File URL Generation**
**Problem**: Create and update methods used different approaches for generating file URLs.

**Fix**:
- Standardized file URL generation across all methods
- Consistent use of `/uploads/filename` format

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `middleware/multer.js`
- Fixed filename sanitization to preserve extensions
- Added PDF verification function
- Improved error handling
- Added file integrity checks

### 2. Updated `index.js`
- Reordered middleware for better file handling
- Added proper static file serving with PDF headers
- Increased size limits appropriately

### 3. Updated `controller/questionBankController.js`
- Standardized file URL generation
- Added better error handling
- Improved validation

### 4. Updated `routes/mainRoutes/questionBankRouters.js`
- Added PDF verification middleware
- Improved error handling chain

## Testing

### Test Server
Run the test server to verify uploads work correctly:
```bash
node testFileUpload.js
```

### Test Page
Open `test-upload.html` in a browser to test file uploads with visual feedback.

### Manual Testing
1. Upload a PDF file
2. Verify the file is saved correctly
3. Check that the file can be opened and is not corrupted
4. Verify the file URL is accessible via browser

## Prevention Measures

1. **File Type Validation**: Only PDF files are accepted
2. **Magic Number Check**: Verifies PDF header (%PDF)
3. **File Integrity**: Checks for proper PDF structure
4. **Size Limits**: 50MB maximum file size
5. **Proper Headers**: Correct Content-Type for served files
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for debugging

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "File is corrupted after upload"
**Solution**: The filename sanitization and PDF verification should prevent this.

### Issue: "File not accessible via URL"
**Solution**: Static file serving is configured with proper headers.

### Issue: "Upload fails with large files"
**Solution**: Increased size limits in both multer and express.

### Issue: "Wrong file type accepted"
**Solution**: Strict MIME type and extension checking.
