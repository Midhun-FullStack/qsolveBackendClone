# Question Bank API Fixes

## Issues Fixed
- [x] Added missing API routes: GET /question-banks/:id, PUT /question-banks/:id, DELETE /question-banks/:id
- [x] Implemented missing controller methods: getQuestionBankById, updateQuestionBank, deleteQuestionBank
- [x] Fixed file URL storage for Cloudinary uploads (using req.file.url || req.file.path)

## Potential Remaining Issues
- [ ] Verify Cloudinary credentials in .env file (couldn't read .env)
- [ ] Test file upload functionality with actual PDF files
- [ ] Ensure authentication middleware is working correctly
- [ ] Test CRUD operations from frontend admin panel

## Next Steps
1. Set up proper Cloudinary environment variables in .env
2. Test creating, updating, and deleting question banks
3. Verify file URLs are correctly stored and accessible
4. Check that bundles can properly reference question banks

## Notes
- The backend now supports all CRUD operations that the frontend expects
- File uploads should work with Cloudinary if credentials are valid
- Authentication is required for most operations except department-based sample fetching
